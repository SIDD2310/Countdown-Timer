# Countdown-Timer

A countdown timer is a type of timer that counts down from a specified amount of time to zero. It is often used in applications such as alarms, stopwatches, and time-limited games. The countdown timer can be set to a specific amount of time, and it will count down in real-time until it reaches zero.

The basic features of a countdown timer include the ability to start, stop, and reset the timer. When the timer is started, it begins counting down from the specified amount of time. The user can stop the timer at any point, and it can be reset to its original starting time. Additionally, many countdown timers also feature a pause and resume function, which allows the user to temporarily pause the timer and then resume it later.

Another common feature of a countdown timer is the ability to customize the timer's behavior when it reaches zero. This can include playing an alarm sound, displaying a message, or even automatically opening a specific application.

Additionally, countdown timers can also be used with graphical user interface (GUI) to make it more user-friendly. This allows the users to input the time easily and also to monitor the remaining time on the screen.

In summary, a countdown timer is a useful tool that can be used in a wide range of applications to track and control the passage of time. Its features include the ability to start, stop, reset, pause and resume the timer, as well as the ability to customize the behavior of the timer when it reaches zero.
